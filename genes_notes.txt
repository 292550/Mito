Things I want genes to control:

(Tile)
* Water Diffusion
* Sugar Diffusion
* Is obstacle

(Cell)
* Time to Build
* Inventory capacity
* Convert sugar to energy
* Take energy from neighboring Cells
* Build cost

(Fruit)
* Immunity to freezing
* Pull resources from neighbors
* Provide reproduction through resource dumping

(Leaf)
* diffuse water with other Leaves
* Pull water from neighbors
* Perform photosynthesis: Water + Air into sugar

(Root)
* absorb water from Soil

(Transport)
* Directional: push water and sugar in a direction

Caaaraaazy ideas:

* not affected by temperatures
* makes nearby cells build faster
* water+sugar make Nutrient
* Convert Toxic to Nutrient
* Consume Energy; +1 slot
* Interact to release Toxins into surrounding soil
* Convert Nutrient into sugar
* Use Nutrient to release aromas (repel enemies, attract allies)
* Protect against fungus
* poisonous - kill things that eat this tile
* faster walk speed on it
* nighttime emits an aroma
* push resources away
* diffusion easier
* diffusion harder
* water that leaves this cell also carries sugar
* move 80% slower, +2
* take much longer to build; +2
* 1 sugar + 1 nutrient = 5 sugar
* nutrient directly into energy (respiration?)
* Turn nearby organic matter in Soil directly into nutrients
* Collect water from adjacent Air tiles
* thorns - insects distance 1 from you cannot get any nearer
* fuzzy - prevent frost 1, prevent heat 1, capture Air water

Things to play with:
* When sunlight hits
* During nighttime
* When infected by disease
* While there is a water on me
* While not hungry
* While there is sugar on me

Required "addon" genes:
* When photosynthesis occurs, produce 0.1 nutrient
* Root hairs - roots suck from all adjacent soil, instead of just one
*
